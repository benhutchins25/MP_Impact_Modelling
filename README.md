_This repository contains the code for my MSci dissertation project, in which I quantify the ozone and climate impacts of the Montreal Protocol, London Amendment and Copenhagen Amendment_ <br />
**Project Title:** The importance of subsequent amendments to the Montreal Protocol for protecting the ozone layer and climate <br />
**Project description** EESC scenarios are extracted from Fig Q14-1 of the WMO.'s 'Twenty Questions and Answers about the Ozone Layer 2018 update'. These scenarios represent the EESC trends in a world without the Montreal Protocol, a world with only the Montreal Protocol, a world with only the Montreal Protocol and the London Amendment and a world with the protocol, London and Copenhagen Amendments. A baseline 'Montreal Amendment 2007' scenario was also extracted. Ozone impacts were quantified using polynomial regression to relate EESC to global-mean total column ozone (using data from Young et al., 2021). Climate impcts were quantified using temperature anomalies and radiative forcing calculated using a concentration drievn run of the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model. <br />
**Project Notes** The EESC scenarios are referred to in the code as NoMP1987, NoLA1990, NoCA1992, NoBA1999 and MA2007 baseline.
